_Welcome to Bootcamp!_

This GitHub repo is where we will share files and slides with you. Below are links to some additional resources that we will talk about as the class goes on.

### Links

[GitHub Step by Step](https://adhire.github.io/git-steps/#!/)

[Submit Labs](https://goo.gl/forms/p4YTWqnAJH6XkX0J2)

[How to Debug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong) - An introduction(for beginners) on how to start fixing syntax and logical errors.

[Need CSS Practice?](https://www.dribbble.com) - Great site to practice CSS.

&#9734; [David's Demo Site](https://dwolverton.github.io/fe-demo/) - A work-in-progress site that demonstrates a few topics including grid layout, CSS positioning and a jQuery playground.

[JS Bin](http://jsbin.com), [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/), [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/), [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [REPL.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) - Sites for playing with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) - a bunch of practice challenges for beginners. Good sections for us: Basic JavaScript, Object Oriented and Functional Programming, Basic Algorithm Scripting, and HTML5 and CSS if you need to brush up on that.

&#9734; [Data Structures Practice #1](https://dwolverton.github.io/jsviz/apps/practice/#/?sets=arrays,objects,arrays-of-objects&sourceUrl=practice.json)
[Data Structures Practice #2](https://dwolverton.github.io/jsviz/apps/practice/#/?sourceUrl=practice-with-start.json&sets=arrays,objects) - Practice those objects and arrays

[CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) - CSS selector practice

[RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) - We do not cover regular expressions (regex) in this class, but if you want to dig into them, they're very useful. Pretty much every programming language has them. In JavaScript regular expressions can be used with [String.match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match), [String.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), [String.search](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search), [String.split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) and the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) object.

### Code Challenge Practice
pg. 17 in your workbook has questions you might be asked in a tech interview.

&#9734; [Practice Core JS Structures](https://dwolverton.github.io/javascript-challenges) - My basic JavaScript practice drills live with test cases.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) - The section called "*Basic Algorithm Scripting*" has some good entry-level code challenges. For trickier challenges, move on to "*Intermediate Algorithm Scripting*" and "*Advanced Algorithm Scripting*".

[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) - These are pretty hard, but if you're ready to push yourself, give it a try.

Sort an array manually without using the `Array.sort()` function. There are a [bunch of ways to do it](http://khan4019.github.io/front-end-Interview-Questions/sort.html#bubbleSort). See the various algoithms [in action](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/).

Of course, you can search the internet for additional code challenges and JS interview questions.
